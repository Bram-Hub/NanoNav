Sensors
=======
Using the IR sensors on NanoNav.

Introduction
------------
To best interact with its environment, your NanoNav kit comes with infrared sensors that can be used for detecting how reflective the surface under it is.

Calibration
-----------
Initially, and if you ever notice the IR sensors not detecting the white line correctly,
you may need to calibrate the sensors. The below video (for a very similar IR sensor model)
shows how to do this.
